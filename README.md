Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to **Supercow**, a collection of useful scripts that I collected along my TI career.

Everybody has some common problems once in a while that could be easily achieved with some sort of script, or some *snippet* that we found in the internet. Well, this is my personal collection. Some of them are infra-related. Others can be installation scripts or even some sort of dumb automation. 

**And you're free to use it and copy all ! ðŸ†“**
